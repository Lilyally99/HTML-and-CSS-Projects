# HTML and CSS Projects

This repository contains a collection of HTML and CSS projects created as part of my web development course.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Practice writing clean and structured HTML
- Apply CSS styling and layout techniques
- Build small projects to strengthen front-end development skills

Each project will be stored in its own folder and will include all necessary files such as HTML, CSS, and assets.
